# Python - Coding Bat Solutions
*Unofficial answers to Python Coding Bat problems*

The problems can be found here: http://codingbat.com/python

## About
I made these solutions while studying for my grade 9 computer science test.  These instructions can be useful to those who are trying the `String-1` and `Logic-1` problems since they do not come with answers.

I have both my solutions for the test, and they can be found in the `test` folder.

## Improvements
__Note:__ *All of these solutions have been tested using Coding Bat's online interface*

If you find a better solution, please fork the repository and submit a pull request or let me know via email at [info@michaelbateman.ca](mailto:info@michaelbateman.ca).  Please note - I will not be changing anything in the `test` folder, only the other files, if a better solution can be found.
